            <h2>Noistage For Students</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>Noistage is a great tool to make studying more efficient. Nobody can concentrate for a prolonged amount of time, thus you can use Noisli to help you study in smaller sessions using our Timer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our background sounds can help you to put yourself into a relaxed study mode and to help you stay concentrated for longer periods of time. This will allow you to reduce the impact of outside distractions such as phone or social media notifications and to study in a more efficient way.
                <bR>
                <br>
                Noistage is also powerful in class, as it allows students to find a calm space among all the other classmates. You can use Noisli to enhance individual concentration or to fuel creative writing by creating an inspiring atmosphere.

            <h2>Noistage For Travels</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>
                If you’re a frequent traveller you will know that finding an environment for peace and calm that lets you focus is very challenging. Being it on your daily commute, on the bus or train, or up in the air, peace and calm is a rarity in such busy environments. You find yourself in ever changing, buzzing places, where the noise environment around you is out of your control.
                <br><br>
                Noistage can be your little helper to enter a familiar workspace in order to get things done and stay productive also on the go.

            <h2>Why Noistage Works?</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>Silence and loud noises are usually associated with danger, thus making us alert. It is the opposite of what we need when we want to focus or relax.
                Background noise on the other hand is a sound that doesn’t contain spikes in volume, that is very constant and rather predictable keeping therefore our inner alarm systems calm.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, due to the high amount of different frequencies contained, background sounds have great masking abilities, reducing the negative impact of sudden spikes in external noise in our environment. While listening to such background sounds, every additional noise adds to the sounds you’re already hearing and doesn’t stand out so much anymore. Therefore, additional noises are blended in and you don’t perceive them as disturbing as you normally would. This is also why music with lyrics can bring us easily out of focus, especially when having to deal with tasks that involve writing or reading. Music tends to be more rhythmic and unpredictable and if it contains lyrics, it will easily mess with your concentration and shift your focus to the lyrics instead of the task at hand.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, the right amount of background noise, not too quiet and not too loud, can also help you to think in a more abstract way enhancing creative thinking.
